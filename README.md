# JQuery-password-strength
This code constructs a registration form with a password strength indicator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users receive real-time feedback on password complexity through color-coded indicators, promoting stronger and more secure password choices. It also features Font Awesome icons for enhanced design aesthetics.
The plugin's secureStrength property contains the score that you consider secure. To determine the password strength, the algorithm computes how many percent of the secure strength a user reached and assigns one of the following five classes to the password strength indicator display element accordingly:
